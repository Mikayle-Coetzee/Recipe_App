# POE_PROG6221_ST10023767_GR01

This C# application allows users to enter an unlimited number of recipes, scale the recipe (including the ingredients quantities, total calories and the unit of measurement will change accordingly), Print A Specific Recipe, Enter Another Recipe , Clear Recipe, or Quit. The project is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it accessible to anyone who wants to enter and scale their recipes.

The main features of the application are:

- Enter an unlimited number of recipes: Users can easily enter a recipe with its ingredients and steps.

- Recipe scaling: Users can scale a selected recipe ingredients by entering a scaling factor.

- Recipe display: Users can select a recipe to view from a list of recipes added and displayed in alphabetical order.

- Calculate the total calories: It would calculate the total calories and check if it is more than three hundred, if it is an alert will display. When displaying the recipe, it should add information about the calorie range. 

- Get information: The user will be able to get information on the calories and the food groups.

This project is specifically developed for a POE and will be used by a lecturer for evaluation purposes. However, it can be used by anyone who wants to enter and scale their recipes.

## Author

This project was created by Mikayle Devonique Coetzee (ST10023767) as part of the POE for the PROG6221 course at Varsity College.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- .NET Framework 4.8

## Installing

To install this application, follow these steps:

3. Open the solution file POE_PROG6221_ST10023767_GR01.sln in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
4. Build the solution using the Build menu.

## Running the Program

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the project.
2. Open POE_PROG6221_ST10023767_GR01 folder.
3. Open bin folder.
4. Open Debug folder.
5. Double-click on the executable file POE_PROG6221_ST10023767_GR01.exe to launch the application.

## Usage

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Enter the number for a song that you would like to listen to.
2. Enter the number for the theme that you would like to be applied.
3. Enter the number 1 if you would like to enter a recipe, and number 2 if you like to quit the application.
4. If you entered one:
- Enter yes or no if you like to go back to the menu.
- if you entered yes: you must then enter the recipe name, followed with the number of ingredients that you would like to enter and the ingredient details. You then must enter the number of steps that you would like to enter, followed with the steps. If the total calorie of a recipe is more than three hundred, an alert will be displayed. 
5. If you entered two: 
- The application will close.
6. You can then choose if you would like to (Print A Specific Recipe, Scale Quantities, Enter Another Recipe, Clear Recipe, or Quit)
7. If you entered the number for 'Print A Specific Recipe', the recipe list in alphabetical order will display and allow you to go back to the main menu or to display a recipe by entering its corresponding number. If the input is valid, it would display the correct recipe that was selected.
8. If you entered the number for 'Scale Quantitiesâ€™, the recipe list in alphabetical order will display and allow you to go back to the main menu or to scale a recipe by entering its corresponding number. You must enter to what factor you would like to scale the quantities to it includes half, double, triple, reset After entering the factor, it would display the scaled recipe. 
- If you then select that you would like to print the recipe, the updated recipe will be printed. 
9. If you entered the number for 'Enter Another Recipe', The recipe list in alphabetical order will display and allow you to go back to the main menu or to enter another recipe.
10. If you entered the number for 'Clear Recipe', the recipe list in alphabetical order will display and allow you to go back to the main menu or to clear a recipe by entering its corresponding number. You are required to enter Yes or No if you would like to clear the selected recipe. If no it would not clear the recipe and display that the clear recipe request has been cancelled and it will go back to the main menu, if yes, it would clear the recipe and display a message that the recipe was successfully deleted.
11. If you entered the number for 'Quit', the application will close after displaying a message. 

## Enhancements and Key Focus Areas in my Part 1 Submission

I achieved a perfect score of 100% for Part 1 of the programming assignment. While I did not receive specific feedback from my lecturer, I approached this task with a strong commitment to ongoing improvement. I would like to highlight the key areas I focused on during my review process.

Firstly, I dedicated time to enhance the efficiency of my code by adjusting some algorithms and data structures. I analysed the complexity of my code and made appropriate adjustments to ensure optimal performance.

Secondly, I conducted additional testing to ensure that all my error handling mechanisms can handle unexpected situations and that it provides meaningful error messages to the user.

Thirdly, I revisited my code's structure, ensuring that I followed best programming practices and the principles we discussed in class. I paid close attention to naming conventions, ensuring clarity and consistency throughout my code. 

Lastly, I improved and expanded a few comments in my code, carefully selecting better words for improved readability.

I believe that these enhancements have made my Part 1 submission even stronger, demonstrating my dedication to delivering high-quality work.
