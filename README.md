# POE_PROG6221_ST10023767_GR01

This C# application allows users to enter a single recipe, scale the recipe ingredients quantities, and display the recipe. The project is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it accessible to anyone who wants to enter and scale their recipes.

The main features of the application are:

- Single recipe entry: Users can easily enter a recipe with its ingredients and quantities.

- Recipe scaling: Users can scale the recipe ingredients quantities by entering a scaling factor.

- Recipe display: Users can view the recipe with the original or scaled ingredient quantities.

This project is specifically developed for a POE and will be used by a lecturer for evaluation purposes. However, it can be used by anyone who wants to enter and scale their recipes.

## Enhancements and Key Focus Areas in my Part 1 Submission

I achieved a perfect score of 100% for Part 1 of the programming assignment. While I did not receive specific feedback from my lecturer, I approached this task with a strong commitment to ongoing improvement. I would like to highlight the key areas I focused on during my review process.

Firstly, I dedicated time to enhance the efficiency of my code by adjusting some algorithms and data structures. I analysed the complexity of my code and made appropriate adjustments to ensure optimal performance.

Secondly, I conducted additional testing to ensure that all my error handling mechanisms can handle unexpected situations and that it provides meaningful error messages to the user.

Thirdly, I revisited my code's structure, ensuring that I followed best programming practices and the principles we discussed in class. I paid close attention to naming conventions, ensuring clarity and consistency throughout my code. 

Lastly, I improved and expanded a few comments in my code, carefully selecting better words for improved readability.

I believe that these enhancements have made my Part 1 submission even stronger, demonstrating my dedication to delivering high-quality work.
