# Recipe App

This C# application allows users to enter an unlimited number of recipes, scale the recipe (including the ingredients quantities, total calories and the unit of measurement will change accordingly), Print A Specific Recipe, Enter Another Recipe , Clear Recipe, Filter a recipe,or Quit. The project is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it accessible to anyone who wants to enter and scale their recipes.

The main features of the application are:

- Enter an unlimited number of recipes: Users can easily enter a recipe with its ingredients and steps.

- Recipe scaling: Users can scale a selected recipe ingredients by selecting a scaling factor.

- Recipe display: Users can select a recipe to view from a list of recipes added and displayed in alphabetical order.

- Calculate the total calories: It would calculate the total calories and check if it is more than three hundred, if it is an alert will display. 

- Get information: The user will be able to get information on the calories and the food groups.

- Filter recipe: The user will be able to filter recipes baced on the ingredient name.

This project is specifically developed for a POE and will be used by a lecturer for evaluation purposes. However, it can be used by anyone who wants to enter and scale their recipes.

## Enhancements and Key Focus Areas in my Part 1 Submission

I achieved a perfect score of 100% for Part 1 of the programming assignment. While I did not receive specific feedback from my lecturer, I approached this task with a strong commitment to ongoing improvement. I would like to highlight the key areas I focused on during my review process.

Firstly, I dedicated time to enhance the efficiency of my code by adjusting some algorithms and data structures. I analysed the complexity of my code and made appropriate adjustments to ensure optimal performance.

Secondly, I conducted additional testing to ensure that all my error handling mechanisms can handle unexpected situations and that it provides meaningful error messages to the user.

Thirdly, I revisited my code's structure, ensuring that I followed best programming practices and the principles we discussed in class. I paid close attention to naming conventions, ensuring clarity and consistency throughout my code. 

Lastly, I improved and expanded a few comments in my code, carefully selecting better words for improved readability.

I believe that these enhancements have made my Part 1 submission even stronger, demonstrating my dedication to delivering high-quality work.

## Enhancements and Key Focus Areas in my Part 2 Submission

For Part 2 of the programming assignment, I have also achieved a flawless score of 100%. 

As I did not receive specific feedback from my lecturer for Part 2, I approached the task with a strong focus on maintaining the code's integrity and ensuring its seamless integration into the application.

My primary objective was to ensure that the code from Part 2 effortlessly integrated with the WPF application in Part 3.  Although I did not make specific changes to the code itself, my efforts were concentrated on utilizing the existing validation code from Part 2 to develop a robust and user-friendly WPF application in Part 3.
